A letter that represents any number from a given set of numbers is called a **monomial**. A sum of two monomials is called a **binomial**, and the sum of three monomials is called a **trinomial**.

## Polynomials

To generalize, we can say that a sum of monomials is a **polynomial**. 

> [!info]
> A **polynomial** in the variable $x$ is an expression of the form 
> $$a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \cdots + a_1x + a_0$$
> where $a_0$, $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ are real numbers, and $n$ is a non-negative integer. If $a_n \ne 0$, then the polynomial has **degree $n$**

 The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial. For example:
 $$7x^3+5xy^6-12$$
 This trinomial has a degree of 6 because the term $5xy^6$ has the highest power of 6.

### Adding and subtracting Polynomials

The easiest way to add and subtract polynomials is by grouping **like terms** using the [[Distributive Property]], like so:
$$5x^7+3x^7=(5+3)x^7 = 8x^7$$
If a - sign precedes any expression then all terms inside the expression become negative:
$$-(b+c)=-b-c$$

#### Example
$$
\begin{align}
&(x^3-6x^2+2x+4)-(x^3+5x^2-7x)\\
&= x^3-6x+2x+4-x^3-5x^2+7x\\
&= (x^3-x^3)+(-6x^2-5x^2)+(2x+7x)+4
\end{align}
$$

### Multiplying Polynomials

When we need the **product** of the [[Factoring#Common factors|factors]] in a polynomial expression, we need to multiply each **term** in one factor by each term in the other factor(s). When multiplying a binomial, for example:
$$(a+b)(c+d)=ac+ad+bc+bd$$

When we multiply trinomials or polynomials with more terms we once again have to use the Distributive Property:
$$\begin{align}
&(2x+3)(x^2-5x+4)\\
&=2x(x^2-5x+4)+3(x^2-5x+4)\\
&=(2x\cdot x^2-2x\cdot 5x+2x\cdot 4)+(3\cdot x^2-3\cdot 5x+3\cdot 4)\\
&=(2x^3-10x^2+8x)+(3x^2-15x+12)\\
&=2x^3-7x^2-7x+12
\end{align}$$

## Special Product Formula

There are certain types of products that are very common, so it is beneficial to memorize them.

>  $$\begin{align}
> 1. &\space (A+B) = A^2-B^2 &\text{Sum and difference of same terms}\\
> 2. &\space (A+B)^2 = A^2+AB+B^2 &\text{Square of a sum}\\
> 3. &\space (A-B)^2 = A^2-2AB+B^2 &\text{Square of a difference}\\
> 4. &\space (A+B)^3 = A^3+3A^2B+3AB^2+B^3 &\text{Cube of a sum}\\
> 5. &\space (A-B)^3 = A^3-3A^2B+3AB^2-B^3 &\text{Cube of a difference}\\
> \end{align}$$

### Example
Here we can use the **Law of Substitution** to apply Product Formula 2 to substitute $x^2$ for $A$ and $y^3$ for $B$:
$$(x^2+y^3)^2 = (x^2)^2+2(x^2)(y^3)+(y^3)^2$$
