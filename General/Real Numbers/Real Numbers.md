## Associative Properties

> [!rule]
> Associative properties are defined as the following: 
> - When we add three (or more) numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we add first
> - When we multiply three (or more) numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we multiply first
> 
> $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
> $$(ab)c = a(bc)$$

## Example

$$(2 + 4) + 7 = 2 + (4 + 7)$$
$$(3 \cdot 7) \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot (7 \cdot 5)$$

## Commutative Properties
> [!rule]
> The commutative properties are defined as following:
> - When we add two numbers, the order does not matter.
> - When we multiply two numbers the order does not matter.
> 
> $$a + b = b + a$$
> $$ab = ba$$

## Example

$$7 + 3 = 3 + 7$$
$$3 \cdot 5 = 5 \cdot 3$$
