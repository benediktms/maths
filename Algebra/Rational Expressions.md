A rational expression is a **fractional expression** where both the numerator and the denominator are [[Variables & Expressions#Polynomials|polynomials]].  This is an example of a rational expression:
$$\frac{x^3-x}{x^2-5x+6}$$
However this is not:
$$\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$$
because the denominator is a [[Radicals|radical]].

## Simplifying rational expressions

We can simplify rational expressions by [[Factoring|factoring]] the numerator and denominator and using the following property of fractions:
$$\frac{AC}{BC}=\frac AB$$
which allows us to **cancel** common factors.

>[!example]
>$$\begin{align}
>&\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+x-2}\\[2ex]
>=\space &\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{(x-1)(x+2)}\space=\space \frac{\cancel{\color{red}{(x-1)}}(x+1)}{\cancel{\color{red}{(x-1)}}(x+2)}\\[2ex]
>=\space &\frac{x+1}{x+2}
>\end{align}$$
>Here we can cancel the common factors of the expression once we have factored it. The same rule applies when we divide the numerator and denominator. For example, given this expression:
>$$\frac{5(x-3)(2x+1)}{10(x-3)^2}$$
>We can divide the denominator and the numerator by $5$:
>$$\frac{(x-3)(2x+1)}{2(x-3)^2}$$
>Then can divide by $(x-3)$ to cancel out that part of the numerator (and reduce the exponent of the denominator by $1$):
>$$\frac{2x+1}{2(x-3)}$$

## Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions

For multiplying rational expressions, we do:
$$\frac AB\cdot\frac CD = \frac{AC}{BD}$$

> To multiply and simplify the following:
> $$\begin{align}\\
> &\frac{x^2+2x-3}{x^28x+16}\cdot\frac{3x+12}{x-1}\\[2ex]
> &=\frac{(x-1)(x+3)}{(x+4)^2}\cdot \frac{3(x+4)}{x-1}\\[2ex]
> &=\frac{3({\color{red}{x-1}})(x+3)({\color{teal}{x+4}})}{({\color{red}{x-1}})({\color{teal}{x+4}})^2}\\[2ex]
> &=\frac{3(x+3)}{x+4}
> \end{align}$$

When dividing rational expressions, we use the following property:
