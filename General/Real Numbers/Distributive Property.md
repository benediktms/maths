> [!definition]
> The distributive property can be defined as following:
> When multipling the sum of two (or more) numbers we get the same result as if we add the products of all the terms
> 
> $$a(b+c) = ab+bc$$
> $$(b+c)a = ab+ac$$

The distributive property is important because it describes how addition and multiplication interact with eachother.

## Example

$$2\cdot(3+5) = 2\cdot3 + 2\cdot5$$
$$(3+5)\cdot2 = 2\cdot3 + 2\cdot5$$
