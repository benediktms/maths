A letter that represents any number form a given set of numbers is called a **mononomial**. A sum of two mononomials is called a **binomial** and a the sum of three mononomials is called a **trinomial**.

## Polynomials

To generalize, we can say that a sum of mononomials is a **polynomial**.

 The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable that appears in the polynomial
