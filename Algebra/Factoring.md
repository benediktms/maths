Factorization is the opposite of expansion. We can use the [[Distributive Property]] for both these use cases. We factor a complex expression as a product of simpler expressions.

For example in the following expression:
$$x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)$$

We can say that $x-2$ and $x+2$ are factors of $x^2-4$

## Common factors
The easiest way to factor an expression is when we have common terms
