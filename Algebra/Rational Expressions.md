A rational expression is a **fractional expression** where both the numerator and the denominator are [[Variables & Expressions#Polynomials|polynomials]].  This is an example of a rational expression:
$$\frac{x^3-x}{x^2-5x+6}$$
However this is not:
$$\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+1}}$$
because the denominator is a [[Radicals|radical]].
