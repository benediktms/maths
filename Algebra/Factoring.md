Factorization is the opposite of expansion. We can use the [[Distributive Property]] for both these use cases. We factor a complex expression as a product of simpler expressions.

For example in the following expression:
$$x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)$$

We can say that $x-2$ and $x+2$ are factors of $x^2-4$

## Common factors

The easiest way to factor an expression is when we have common terms

> [!terms and factors]
> When we multiply two numbers together, each number is called a **factor** of the product. When we add two numbers together, each number is called a **term** of the sum.
> 
> If a factor is common to each term of an expression we can factor it out. For example
> $$ax+2ay$$
> Each term contains the factor $a$ so we can write the expression as:
> $$ax+2ay = a(x+2y)$$
