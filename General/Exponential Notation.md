A prodcut of identical numbers can be written with exponential notation. For example $5\cdot5\cdot5$ can be written as $5^3$.

If $a$ is a [[Real Numbers|real number]]  and $n$ is a positive integer then the **$n$th power** of $a$ is
$$a^n=a\cdot a\cdot \cdots \cdot a$$
The number $a$ is called the **base**, and $n$ us called the **exponent**.

## Laws of Exponents
Assuming bases $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and  exponents $m$ and $n$ are integers, these are the laws of exponents:
