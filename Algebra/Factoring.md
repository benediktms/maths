Factorization is the opposite of expansion. We can use the [[Distributive Property]] for both these use cases. We factor a complex expression as a product of simpler expressions.

For example in the following expression:
$$x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)$$

We can say that $x-2$ and $x+2$ are factors of $x^2-4$

## Common factors

The easiest way to factor an expression is when we have common terms

> [!terms and factors]
> When we multiply two numbers together, each number is called a **factor** of the product. When we add two numbers together, each number is called a **term** of the sum.
> 
> If a factor is common to each term of an expression we can factor it out. For example
> $$ax+2ay$$
> Each term contains the factor $a$ so we can write the expression as:
> $$ax+2ay = a(x+2y)$$

### Example
$$8x^4y^2+6x^3y^3-2xy^4$$
- 8, 6 and -2 have the greatest common factor of 2
- $x^4$,  $x^3$, and $x$ have the greatest common factor of $x$
- $y^2$, $y^3$, and $y^4$ have the greatest common factor of $y$

The greatest common factor in the three terms is the [[polynomial|Polynomial]]
