## Associative Properties

> [!rule]
> Associative properties are defined as the following: 
> - When we add three (or more) numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we add first
> - When we multiply three (or more) numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we multiply first
> 
> $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
> $$(ab)c = a(bc)$$
> > [!example]
> > $$(2 + 4) + 7 = 2 + (4 + 7)$$
> > $$(3 \cdot 7) \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot (7 \cdot 5)$$

## Commutative Properties

> [!rule]
> The commutative properties are defined as following:
> - When we add two numbers, the order does not matter.
> - When we multiply two numbers, the order does not matter.
> 
> $$a + b = b + a$$
> $$ab = ba$$
> >[!example]
> >$$7 + 3 = 3 + 7$$
> >$$3 \cdot 5 = 5 \cdot 3$$

## Distributive Property
> [!rule]
> The distributive property can be defined as following:
> When multiplying the sum of two (or more) numbers, we get the same result as if we add the products of all the terms
> 
> $$a(b+c) = ab+bc$$
> $$(b+c)a = ab+ac$$
> >[!example]
> >$$2\cdot(3+5) = 2\cdot3 + 2\cdot5$$
> >$$(3+5)\cdot2 = 2\cdot3 + 2\cdot5$$


The distributive property is important because it describes how addition and multiplication interact with each other.
