Real numbers can be divided into 3 different kinds:
- Natural numbers: any integer that is $<0$, e.g. $1,2,3,4,\cdots$
- Integers: any natural number as well as their negative counterparts and $0$, e.g. $-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3$
- Rational numbers: fractions or ratios of integers, they are expressed as $$r = \frac mn$$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n \neq 0$, e.g: $\frac 37, 0.16$. Division by $0$ is ruled out, so $\frac 30$ or $\frac 00$ is undefined.
- Irrational numbers: A number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers such as $\sqrt 2$ or $\pi$

The set of all real numbers can be denoted as $\mathbb R$. Every real number has a decimal representation. If the number is rational the  decimal is repeating, e.g. $$\frac23=0.6666\cdots=0.\overline6$$
$$\frac{157}{495}=0.317171717\cdots=0.3\overline{17}$$

## Associative Properties

> [!rule]
> Associative properties are defined as the following: 
> - When we add three (or more) numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we add first
> - When we multiply three (or more) numbers, it does not matter which two numbers we multiply first
> 
> $$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
> $$(ab)c = a(bc)$$
> > [!example]
> > $$(2 + 4) + 7 = 2 + (4 + 7)$$
> > $$(3 \cdot 7) \cdot 5 = 3 \cdot (7 \cdot 5)$$

## Commutative Properties

> [!rule]
> The commutative properties are defined as following:
> - When we add two numbers, the order does not matter.
> - When we multiply two numbers, the order does not matter.
> 
> $$a + b = b + a$$
> $$ab = ba$$
> >[!example]
> >$$7 + 3 = 3 + 7$$
> >$$3 \cdot 5 = 5 \cdot 3$$

## Distributive Property
> [!rule]
> The distributive property can be defined as following:
> When multiplying the sum of two (or more) numbers, we get the same result as if we add the products of all the terms
> 
> $$a(b+c) = ab+bc$$
> $$(b+c)a = ab+ac$$
> >[!example]
> >$$2\cdot(3+5) = 2\cdot3 + 2\cdot5$$
> >$$(3+5)\cdot2 = 2\cdot3 + 2\cdot5$$

The distributive property is important because it describes how addition and multiplication interact with each other.

## Addition and Subtraction
- $0$ is called the **additive identity** because $a+0=1$ for any real number
- Every real number has a negative $-a$ that satisfies $a+(-a)=0$
- Subtraction is defined as $a-b=a+(-b)$
>[!properties of negatives]
>1. $(-1)a=-a$
>2. $-(-a)=a$
>3. $(-a)b=a(-b)=-(ab)$
>4. $(-a)(-b)=ab$
>5. $-(a+b)=-a-b$
>6. $-(a-b)=b-a$

## Multiplication and Division
- $1$ is called the **multiplicative identity** because $a\cdot1=a$
- Every nonzero real number has an inverse $1/a$ that satisfies $a\cdot(1/a)$
- Division is defined as $a\div b =a\cdot \frac 1b$ where $b \neq0$
