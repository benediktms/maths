Factorization is the opposite of expansion. We can use the [[Distributive Property]] for both these use cases. We factor a complex expression as a product of simpler expressions.

For example in the following expression:
$$x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)$$

We can say that $x-2$ and $x+2$ are factors of $x^2-4$

## Common factors

The easiest way to factor an expression is when we have common terms. Therefore when we need to factorise an expression, we need to find the greates common factor of all the terms.

> [!terms and factors]
> When we multiply two numbers together, each number is called a **factor** of the product. When we add two numbers together, each number is called a **term** of the sum.
> 
> If a factor is common to each term of an expression we can factor it out. For example
> $$ax+2ay$$
> Each term contains the factor $a$ so we can write the expression as:
> $$ax+2ay = a(x+2y)$$

### Example
$$8x^4y^2+6x^3y^3-2xy^4$$
- 8, 6 and -2 have the greatest common factor of 2
- $x^4$,  $x^3$, and $x$ have the greatest common factor of $x$
- $y^2$, $y^3$, and $y^4$ have the greatest common factor of $y$

The greatest common factor of the three terms in the [[Variables#Polynomials|polynomial]] is $2xy^2$:
$$8x^4y^2+6x^3y^3-2xy^4 = (2xy^2)(4x^3)+(2xy^2)(3x^2y)+(2xy^2(-y^2)$$
$$=2xy^2(4x^3+3x^2y-y^2)$$
